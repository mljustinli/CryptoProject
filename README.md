# CryptoProject
When writing a grid in a file, make sure it's 8x8 and is only made up of 1s and 0s. 1s represent holes and 0s represent non holes.

Make sure files that you want to decrypt have exactly 64 characters per line, and files that you want to encrypt have less than or exactly 64 characters per line.
The caret symbol ^ is a special character so make sure not to put that in your message.
